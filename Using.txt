## üü° SmartScreen Warning on First Launch

When you first run Kryptex, Windows may display a SmartScreen alert saying  
the app is from an "unknown publisher."  

This is **normal for new applications** and does **not** mean the file is unsafe.  
Kryptex is private, clean, and works fully offline by default.
